# Two dimensional array

This assignment should help you to refresh your knowledge on working with two-dimensional arrays.
Your task is to implement all methods in the [TwoDimensionalArray](src/main/java/course/rit/javafundamentals/twodimensionalarray/TwoDimensionalArray.java) class.

Unit tests are provided in the [TwoDimensionalArrayTests](src/test/java/course/rit/javafundamentals/twodimensionalarray/TwoDimensionalArrayTests.java) class to verify the correctness of your implementation.
You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```

This will compile your code, run the tests, and output the results.
